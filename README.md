# Advent of Code

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

## 2020

Learning Haskell. Please be gentle.

## 2021

Still learning Haskell. All days are under the same executable, to pick your day/part just pass a param. E.g. day 1 part 2:

```sh
cabal run -- 1 2 < inputs/day1.txt
```

## 2022

Reverting to Rust cause I just want to get it done this year.

```sh
cargo run -- 1 2 # Reads input from input/day1.txt
```
